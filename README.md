# Open Source Browser Patches
Patches and build configuration to customize an open source browser to my preferences.
These patches would not be accepted upstream as they are contrary to how the vendor has decided they want things to work.

All changes are organized by the source control repository they belong to.

All patches here should be considered completely untested, come as-is with absolutely no warranty, and should only be used at your own risk.
